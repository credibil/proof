//! #Service
//!
//! Services are used to express ways of communicating with the DID subject or
//! associated entities.
//!
//! They can be any type of service the DID subject wants
//! to advertise, including decentralized identity management services for
//! further discovery, authentication, authorization, or interaction.
//!
//! Service information is often service specific. For example, a reference to
//! an encrypted messaging service can detail how to initiate the encrypted link
//! before messaging begins.
//!
//! Due to privacy concerns, revealing public information through services, such
//! as social media accounts, personal websites, and email addresses, is
//! discouraged.
